## Configuring Apache to use the hardware crypto
This section provides information about how to configure an Apache web server under RHEL to exploit cryptographic hardware functions available with IBM Z.

The Apache interface to OpenSSL is the mod ssl module. OpenSSL provides built-in CPACF-support for AES in ECB, CBC, CTR, CCM and GCM mode, SHA-1, SHA-256 and SHA-512 as well as for the latter two in their truncated versions, SHA-224 respectively SHA-384. 

The ibmca engine is the OpenSSL interface to the libica library which provides CPACF-support for various ciphers, MACs and hashes, for NIST SP 800-90 compliant pseudo-random number generation as well as support for Crypto Express (CEX5S) adapters in Accelerator (CEX5A/CEX6A) or CCA Coprocessor (CEX5C/CEX6C) mode. 

These crypto-adapters accelerate the modular exponentiation operation that is used in the RSA, DH and DSA public-key crypto systems.

If a CEX5C adapter is available, its hardware random number generator is used to seed libicaâ€™s pseudo random number generation.

### Installing Apache and the pre-requisite packages
To enable the secure server, you must have the following packages installed at a minimum:

* httpd - The httpd package contains the httpd daemon and related utilities, configuration files, icons, Apache HTTP Server modules, man pages, and other files used by the Apache HTTP Server.

* mod_ssl - The mod_ssl package includes the mod_ssl module, which provides strong cryptography for the Apache HTTP Server via the Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) protocols.

* openssl - The openssl package contains the OpenSSL toolkit. The OpenSSL toolkit implements the SSL and TLS protocols, and also includes a general purpose cryptography library.

To instal the required packages, please issue the following command:
```
[root@ghrhel74crypt conf]# yum install httpd openssl openssl-ibmca mod_ssl
```
To start apache, please issue the following command:
```
SSLCryptoDevice ibmca
#SSLCryptoDevice ubsec
```

### Configuring Apache
The Apache configuration files reside in /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf
The mod ssl_module configuration file is /etc/httpd/conf.d/ssl.conf

Let's change the configuration file of mod_ssl to enable hardware acceleration of SSL/TLS communication of Apache. Please edit the following configuration file issuing the following command:
```
[root@ghrhel74crypt conf]# vi /etc/httpd/conf.d/ssl.conf
```

From there, add the following line to your configuration (or if SSLCryptoDevice is already set, "ubsec" by "ibmca" as follow:
```
SSLCryptoDevice ibmca
#SSLCryptoDevice ubsec
```
