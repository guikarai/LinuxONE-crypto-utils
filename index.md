## Hands-on LAB : Exploiting Crypto Express & CPACF Hardware with Linux on IBM Z / LinuxONE

As of March 2018, the IBM Z / LinuxONE has two categories of crypto hardware.
• CPACF– Provides support for symmetric ciphers and secure hash algorithms (SHA) on every central processor. The potential encryption/decryption throughput scales with the number of CPs.
• CEX –The Crypto Express feature traditionally could be configured in two ways: Either as cryptographic Coprocessor (CEXC) for secure key encrypted transactions, or as cryptographic Accelerator (CEXA) for Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) acceleration. A CEXA works in clear key mode. The Crypto Express 4S allows for a third mode as a Secure IBM CCA Coprocessor
